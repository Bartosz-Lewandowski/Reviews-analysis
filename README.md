# Reviews analysis
## General info
In this project I analyzed the opinions of amazon users about telephone products, or those related to telephones. I found information such
as best-selling products, popular reviews, trusted users, and other data patterns. I built a product recommendation system, and thanks to the NLTK library I was able to find positive and negative comments.
This was the first time I used NLTK library and work with NLP.
## Data information
This dataset consists of reviews from amazon. The data span a period of 18 years, including ~35 million reviews up to March 2013. Reviews include product and user information, ratings, and a plaintext review. Data I used only concerned telephones, products related to them and contain about 79 thousand reviews.
